In this letter, we assess the influence of lightweight block and stream ciphers on energy consumption and hardware resources of wearable devices networks. Differently from the literature, we present an empirical and hardware-driven evaluation of the most representative encryption algorithms with regard to the requirements of wearable networks. We design and implement a cryptography library useful for wireless wearable networks. Results confirm a strong correlation between the amount of logic/arithmetic operations and energy consumption under two communication standards of the IEEE 802.15 family.
